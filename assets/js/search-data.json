            "title": "Logging in ASP.NET Core (Part 1 - Configuration)",
            "content": "Intro . There are multiple ways to log informations in ASP.NET and theres a wide variety of frameworks to make it fit your usecase. . But this article will be about the Default logging of ASP.NET, because it&#39;s important to understand the fundamentals before you advance to more complex toolings. . Default Config . When you start with one of the Visual Studio Application Templates logging is enabled by default. . But its only configured to a degree and only to show C# and ASP.NET logs of a certain level. . Lets checkout the default appsettings.Development.json: . { &quot;DetailedErrors&quot;: true, &quot;Logging&quot;: { &quot;LogLevel&quot;: { &quot;Default&quot;: &quot;Information&quot;, &quot;Microsoft.AspNetCore&quot;: &quot;Warning&quot; } } } . There are only two root keys. While DetailedErrors might sound &#39;interesting&#39;, its not what we&#39;re looking for, since it only deals with Exceptions. . What we&#39;re looking for is the Logging Section. It&#39;s a Dictionary of Category and their logging level. The Default key is special, since it provides the default level for all unconfigured categories. . Categories . Everytime a Logger is created, a category is specified. That category is included with each log message created by that instance of the Logger. The category string is arbitrary, but the convention is to use the class name. . For example in our current Config the Category Microsoft.AspNetCore affects the logging of the Asp.NET Framwork itself. . With the current configuration we have a Log level of Warning from the AspNetCore Framework and Information for everything else. . Let&#39;s try it, start your Application using F5 and have a Look at the output in the CMD Window that opens. . The output in your CMD window should look similiar to this: . info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14] Now listening on: https://localhost:7252 info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14] Now listening on: http://localhost:5252 info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0] Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down. info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0] Hosting environment: Development info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0] Content root path: C: Users magoerlich source repos BlazorSandbox BlazorSandbox . Since Microsoft.Hosting has not a specified log level, it inherits the Default one and so we see these logs. . But we don&#39;t see any Microsoft.AspNetCore entries, since the log level is set to warning and there currently should&#39;nt be any warnings in your application. . Customize the basic config . Lets change the Logging level of Microsoft.AspNetCore to Information as well. . To do this, either delete the Microsoft.AspNetCore line from your config, to make it inherit the default as well, or you can set it explicitly like this: . { ... &quot;Logging&quot;: { ... &quot;Microsoft.AspNetCore&quot;: &quot;Information&quot; ... } } . Now lets restart the application and watch a flood of loggs flow through our CMD Window: . hide-collapse . info: Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.KeyManagement.XmlKeyManager[63] User profile is available. Using &#39;C: Users magoerlich AppData Local ASP.NET DataProtection-Keys&#39; as key repository and Windows DPAPI to encrypt keys at rest. info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14] Now listening on: https://localhost:7252 info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14] Now listening on: http://localhost:5252 info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0] Application started.

Your output might vary slightly, but the important change you should be able to observe is that there are more logs than before and all of them Start with info: Microsoft.AspNetCore .... . These messages were supresed through the config before. . Log Level . There are more log levels than just Information and Warning. Each with its own semantics and verbosity. . Here&#39;s a list, try a few of these with the Microsoft.AspNet Category to experiment: . None | Critical | Error | Warning | Information | Debug | Trace | . You can find further information about the semantics of these levels in the .NET Core Documentation . Thats it for today. In the next part, we&#39;ll take a look at how to use all of this when writing logs from your own code. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
