My name ist Manuel Thomas GÃ¶rlich and i'm a 32 year old Software Developer from Germany.

Comming from a Linux Background, i started a position as a .NET Core and Powershell Dev.
The main reason for this blog is to document my learnings on this path, for later personal reference, but also to share my knowledge with the community.

Although the content is work related, it's still a personal work and in no way does any of this reflect the opinons of my employee.
